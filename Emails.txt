Dear Students,
We hope this message finds you well. We want to bring to your attention that over the weekend, there have been four cases of Chickenpox detected among our student body. Three cases involve First Year Students residing in one hostel, and one case involves a Third Year Student in another hostel.

Upon detection, all affected students have been promptly isolated, and comprehensive protocols for sanitization and preventive measures have been rigorously implemented across the campus. We want to assure you that there is no "outbreak" situation, and the current measures taken are strictly precautionary.

While there is no immediate need for further measures, we are closely monitoring the situation. Rest assured, your health and safety remain our utmost priority. We will keep you updated on any developments, and we assure you that necessary steps will be taken as per the guidance of healthcare authorities and our institutional protocols.

In the meantime, we urge all students to remain vigilant and adhere to personal hygiene practices, such as regular handwashing and avoiding close contact with individuals exhibiting symptoms of illness. Additionally, if you experience any symptoms or have concerns about your health, please do not hesitate to seek medical attention promptly.

We kindly request your cooperation and understanding during this time. Let us continue to support each other and maintain a safe and healthy campus environment.

For any further queries or concerns, please feel free to reach out to your respective hostel authorities or Office of the Dean of Students.

Stay safe and take care.
